# ToolBox.

This is an exercise to teach myself how to create and implement an XML schema, 
collect and display data in that schema's format, and mark it up as a front end 
application using XSLT.

The live website can be accessed [here](https://toolbox.matl.me). 

This is a more of a historical project to learn about W3C technologies. That being
said, XML and XSLT are still widely used in the digital humanities, museums, and in 
libraries.
